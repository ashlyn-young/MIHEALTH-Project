I think what I struggled most with in this project was figuring out how to separate the nav bar, as well as how to place and align text on top of an image. I think I'm learning how to work better with divs and I recognize that I definitely can be 'collapsing' or minimizing some of the repeated text that appear throughout my css stylesheet!

Thank you for looking!
